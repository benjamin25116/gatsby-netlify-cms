We are young adults aged 19 and above. We are passionate in caring for each other and sharing the love of Jesus with the world. We meet every Tuesday night in the church auditorium starting at 7.00pm. We discuss issues regarding life, the workplace and relationships. Once a month we hangout over a steamboat meal, pizza or even a jungle trek! For more information contact us here.
