Our ministry (for children aged 5 to 12 years of age) centres on the Godly Play curriculum which encourages children to explore, hear and listen to God. Subsequently, children are encouraged to respond to God themselves making their time with us a deeply spiritual and child centred experience. Our teacher are trained in the Godly Play methodology with many being Montessori trained as well. For more information contact us here
