In Preparation towards a season of focused prayer and fasting. It is always an excellent decision to start a new season by setting aside 21 days for fasting and prayer. This is a time to abstain from food for spiritual growth, for definite answers to prayer, to set aside more time for prayer, and to set our heart toward seeking and waiting upon the Lord. By focusing our time in reading and meditating the Word of God, it will maximise the season’s of fruitfulness.

According to Acts 4:31,It speaks of a place of united prayer that resulted in a supernatural shaking in them personally and externally around them.

“Shaken” prayer is a united prayer encounter that shakes everything around and in us. Prayer is a powerful force that achieves supernatural results and obtains things seemed impossible and out of reach. Heaven is stirred to move and to act on earth in the affairs of men. Prayer is the language of heaven that God hears and answers. According to Jer 33:3,God says He has some mind-blowing things to show us and reveal to us only When we Call upon Him in Prayer.

We must be Shaken to Pray and removed hindrances that stopping us from praying. We made a Decision to Pray and decided not to give in feeling, not going to make weak excuses. We are not allowing the devil to stop and procrastinate no more.

There is intensity in prayer when we focus, especially when we unite together and fast. There are 9 areas of our Shaken Prayer Focus:

1. Shake us out of spiritual dullness and prayerlessness.
2. Shake the mountains of resistance
3. Shake people free from Satan’s hold
4. Shake chains of mediocrity and limitations off
5. Shake off hindrances to Godly marriages
6. Shake strongholds from our minds
7. Shake off unbelief for healing
8. Shake off financial resistance
9. Shake the gates of Hell
