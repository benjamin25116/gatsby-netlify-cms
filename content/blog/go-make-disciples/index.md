We are so connected digitally. In fact, this is the most digitally connected generation ever. Yet, loneliness, depression is at the highest ever. Social media is in your face all the time. In fact, many cannot communicate without it. We look at the likes we get and it gives us a sense of security and popularity. We consider that connecting with people. Yet, people are lonely. Many get cheated of their money and even get sexually entangled, even blackmailed while looking for love and companionship through the social media.

We are all looking for a connection. An authentic, real, life giving, secure, protective and loving connections. Connections, with people not through a click or a like, but rather through a person reaching out authentically. In Matthew 22:37-39, Jesus is asked a question about what is the GREATEST commandment in the Law. When we think Law, we think of Dos and Don’ts, rules etc. Jesus now presents to us all the core character to life and relationships... And Jesus replied to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself \[that is, unselfishly seek the best or higher good for others].’

John 13:34-35 (MSG), “*Let me give you a new command: Love one another. In the same way I loved you, you love one another. This is how everyone will recognize that you are my disciples—when they see the love you have for each other*.”

Just before He goes up into heaven, He leaves one very important instruction...

Matthew 28:18-20 Jesus came up and said to them, “*All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations (to all peoples everywhere), \[help the people to learn of Me, believe in Me, and obey My words], baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe everything that I have commanded you (i.e. teach them to do everything I have told you); and I am with you always..*.”

Go, Make Disciples’ is all about connecting with God and others.
