It all begins with us making that very important decision of giving our lives to Christ, admitting our need for a Savior, making Him our Lord and Saviour. We receive His forgiveness and experience His acceptance, love and purpose. It does not and cannot end there.

We must now allow God to work in our lives as we learn from His word what it means to be a believer, how to begin to live this new life He has given us. We become part of the community of faith. Everyday God is working in our lives. The work of sanctification takes place. We serve Him, connect in smaller groups where we share a more intimate fellowship and build friendships. We become more accountable with others. But it does not stop there. We start that process with others now.

Making disciples for Christ STARTS with US and MUST NOT end with us!
