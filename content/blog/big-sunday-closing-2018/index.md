One action, one attitude, one word will capture what we want to pursue 2019: PRIORITY

* Pursuing God
* Rebuilding Altars
  I want to comment on the first two attitudes together.

Without a doubt we know that these are disciplines that we have to build daily. We don’t have it if we don’t do it intentionally. We will remain the same in our spiritual condition. No progress. It requires a single eye and bold, stubborn determination.

1. TAKING THE CHALLENGE OF WAKING UP EARLY TO SEEK GOD IN 2019. The Bible and the history of the church is filled with men and women who put “first things first” in going Godward to start their day. This shouldn’t be that surprising given that it’s recorded of our Lord in Mark 1:35, “In the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house, and went away to a secluded place, and was praying there.”
2. Devotions and praying means I have spent time in His presence before my day begins, before all other demands and distractions come in. Taking time for morning devotions means that I’ve already expressed my dependence on Him and asked His guidance and help. Morning devotions show Him that I will center my day around who He is and not what I have to do and get done. Each morning is an opportunity to spend quiet moments with God, renewing our commitment to Him.  For many, we have broken down prayer altars, with no fire on it and it is forsaken. We want to Rebuild our Altar!
3. Rebuilding our Altars expresses:

   1. Our dedication towards God
   2. They reflect our own spiritual condition and attitude
   3. Our commitment towards our families and the next generation
